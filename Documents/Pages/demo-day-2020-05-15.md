The first demo day for the Boardz.app system. 

### Who Joined?
Jeff & Kyle

### Topics
- VueJs & Vuex TypeScript module architecture
- VueJs Authentication module
- "BPC" - Build | Pack | Copy npm package management process
- WebSockets using Socket.io
- Chat Server

#### Module Architecture using TypeScript, VueJs, Vuex, and Socket.io

The system is being built towards a component based architecture. This means the goals is to build the smallest possible unique feature into an independent component that can be used inside other modules.

Everything is written in TypeScript using Jest for unit testing

Currently the Boardz.app system has the following modules:

- Client (VueJs)
- Api
- Auth
- Auth UI (VueJs)
- Boardz
- Boardz UI (VueJs)
- Config
- Server


#### "BPC" - The Build | Pack | Copy npm package management process


#### WebSockets using Socket.io


#### Chat Server


### Feedback


### Parking Lot

- "App this Board" button
- "Push to talk" / "Push to video" modules


## Retrospective

##### Unit Tests
The architecture stabilized this week so no more slacking on tests. The BPC process encourages unit tests so that should help.

Goal: Code Coverage metrics

##### Client Dependencies
Still having issues with the Client app BPC process. Work out the issues and bake it into Gulp.

##### Gulp the BCP
Manual steps should move into Gulp Tasks. Package level to start. It can run unit tests and then when they pass package the module and copy it.

Goal: Build out basic Gulp flow

##### Abstract Socket.on configuration
Everything inside of configureListeners can be abstracted to just work based on the Vuex store MutationTree.

Goal: Eliminate Socket.io config code inside the modules

##### Extract Auth Server
Currently it's in the boardz. Move it to it's own folder. Then move them all out to modules.

Goal: Move it!

##### Client Errors
Decide how to handle client side errors for now. Ideally use something to give devtools in all browsers and include xhr, sockets, and JS errors.

Goal: Look into options and cleanup existing console logging
